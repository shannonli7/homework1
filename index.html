		I am a Lecturer IV in the School of Information at the <a href="https://umich.edu/"> University of Michigan </a>. I focus on the introductory programming courses such as Data-Oriented Programming (SI 206) and the Web Design Courses (SI 339 and SI
		539).

		My previous jobs include Associate Professor at <a href="https://www.csulb.edu/"> California State University </a> and positions at NASA JPL, the Naval Research Lab, and the NSA. I received my BS from <a href="https://www.kent.edu/"> Kent State
			University </a> Honors College in Computer Science, and an MS and PhD from the
		<a href="https://www.pitt.edu/"> University of Pittsburgh </a>, also in Computer Science. My thesis was on Artificial Intelligence applications on the Nursebot Project, a robotic assistant for the elderly.
